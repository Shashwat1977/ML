<h1>Breast Cancer Prediction using Predictive Analytics model</h1>
<h2>Objective:</h2>
<p>The repository is a learning exercise to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Apply the fundamental concepts of machine learning from an available dataset</li>
<li>Evaluate and interpret and justify our results and interpretation based on observed dataset in Jupyter notebook</li>
</ul>

The analysis is divided into four sections, saved in juypter notebooks in this repository
<ul>
  <li>Identifying the problem and Data Sources</li>
  <li>Exploratory Data Analysis</li>
  <li>Pre-Processing the Data</li>
  <li>Build model to predict whether breast cell tissue is malignant or Benign</li>
</ul>
