The repository is a learning exercise to:

Apply the fundamental concepts of machine learning from an available dataset
Evaluate and interpret and justify our results and interpretation based on observed dataset in Jupyter notebook
The analysis is divided into four sections, saved in juypter notebooks in this repository

Identifying the problem and Data Sources
Exploratory Data Analysis
Pre-Processing the Data
